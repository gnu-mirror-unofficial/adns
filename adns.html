<h1>adns</h1>

<strong>Advanced, easy to use, asynchronous-capable DNS client
library.</strong>

<p>

adns is a resolver library for C (and C++) programs.  In contrast with
the existing interfaces, gethostbyname et al and libresolv, it has the
following features:

<ul>

<li>It is reasonably easy to use for simple programs which just want
to translate names to addresses, look up MX records, etc.

<li>It can be used in an asynchronous, non-blocking, manner.  Many
queries can be handled simultaneously.

<li>Responses are decoded automatically into a natural representation
for a C program - there is no need to deal with DNS packet formats.

<li>Sanity checking (eg, name syntax checking, reverse/forward
correspondence, CNAME pointing to CNAME) is performed automatically.

<li>Time-to-live, CNAME and other similar information is returned in
an easy-to-use form, without getting in the way.

<li>There is no global state in the library; resolver state is an
opaque data structure which the client creates explicitly.  A program
can have several instances of the resolver.

<li>Errors are reported to the application in a way that distinguishes
the various causes of failure properly.

<li>Understands conventional resolv.conf, but this can overridden by
environment variables.

<li>Flexibility.  For example, the application can tell adns to:
ignore environment variables (for setuid programs), disable sanity
checks eg to return arbitrary data, override or ignore resolv.conf in
favour of supplied configuration, etc.

<li>Believed to be correct !  For example, will correctly back off to
TCP in case of long replies or queries, or to other nameservers if
several are available.  It has sensible handling of bad responses etc.

</ul>

<h2>Forthcoming:</h2>

I hope that future versions may also have the following features:

<ul>

<li>The library will be useable by threads in a multithreaded program
in a natural way.  It will multiplex many threads' queries through a
single query socket.

<li>Limited caching behaviour.

<li>IPv6 support.

</ul>

(Technical note: adns requires a real nameserver like BIND or
<A href="http://www.dents.org/">Dents</A> running on
the same system or a nearby one, which must be willing to provide
`recursive service'.  I.e., adns is a `stub resolver'.  All properly
configured UN*X and GNU systems will already have such nameserver(s);
they are usually listed in /etc/resolv.conf.)

<h2>Documentation</h2>

I'm afraid there is no manual yet.  However, competent C programmers
should be able to use the library based on the commented
<A href="http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~ian/adns/adns.h.0.1.txt">adns.h</A>
header file (from version 0.1).
